## Planning Story

I first started mapping out my wire frames and erds. Once I had a clear grasp on that, I started writing psuedo code. Once I felt comfortable with my plan I started on the back end. Thankfully since I had already had familiarity with Ruby on Rails, I felt a bit more was able to complete this quickly. Once I successfully implemented my backend and was able to complete all crud actions, I moved to the front end. This was the first time that I had used React and it was quite the experience. However, I did find that because I was meticulous with my planning and broke down the steps, I felt a lot more prepared to tackle the errors that I encountered(which were many).
